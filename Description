Tell us what your idea is. 

FeatApp is an app that adds to the present messangers (like whatsapp, Messenger, Viber, etc) a new feature of Voive to Text capability.
None messanger has this feature, though a plenty amount of people struggling texting long messages. They use voice clips, but this is 
not always compfortable to the receivers. Voice-to-Text feature will allow users to create long texting messages fast on the go.


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 

We will create an light add-on app that will deploy this feature within messanger apps. 
We'd be honored to receive mentoring support from Google in correct relization of this project.
January '20 - MVP ready to beta testing.
March '20 - updated app with cleared bugs distributed as an app on Google Play
May '20 - app is normally used by users worldwide
